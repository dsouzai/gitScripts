This repo is a personal repo that I'm using to house all my git scripts. I figure this way, if anything happens to my computer, it should be trivial to get my git setup going again.


```
The current source layout is:

parentDir
   omr
   openj9

gitSyncRepos.sh goes to each of those folders and updates each repo.

```
